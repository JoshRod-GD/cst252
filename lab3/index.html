		<p> The purpose of this Lab is to learn about how to structure files
			  within my PC.

	<h2> Challenges</h2>
		<p> The only issue that I did run into while working on this was when I
        was setting it up was I did have a small issue was making sure my files
				are exactly at and making sure I link them to the right location.
